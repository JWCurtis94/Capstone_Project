## üìù Footer Note

- **High Injection Count During Project**: During this project, I encountered unusually high injection counts when committing changes, reaching up to 40,000 injections at times. Initially, both my tutors and I were unsure of the cause. Toward the end of the project, we discovered that the issue was related to an extra static folder containing a large number of files and subdirectories, which I had mistakenly assumed was generated by Django. After identifying and removing the unnecessary folder, the injection counts returned to normal.
